        beenrevoked) The status applies to the event, not to the trip as a whole. Insertion or removal of a single stop will usually affect two events at once: one arrival and one departure event. Note that these two events do not have to belong to the same stop. For example, removing the last stop of a trip will result in arrival cancellation for the last stop and of departure cancellation for the stop before the last. So asymmetric cancellations of just arrival or departure for a stop can occur.
